# WebVid Dataset
Large-scale text-video dataset, containing 10M video-text pairs scraped from the web. This dataset was used for large-scale pretraining to achieve state-of-the-art end-to-end retrieval in our frozen-in-time work: the code of which can be found [here](https://github.com/m-bain/frozen-in-time)

## FAQs

**Q1**: Can you provide the original videos for download?

**A1**: Since we do not own the videos in the dataset, we cannot legally provide them to you. The video owner(s) can choose to delete it at anytime, in which case the video will no longer be available in the dataset. Due to this, unfortunately, some videos in the dataset will be lost over time, and we are unable to help with this issue.
###

**Q2**: Is it normal that a subset of videos cannot be retrieved from the provided URLs?

**A2**: Yes. See Q1.

###

**Q3**: Can you provide download scripts in this repository?

**A2**: No, contact me privately if you need advice on how to download.
