## FAQs

**Q1**: Can you provide the original videos for download?

**A1**: Since we do not own the videos in the dataset, we cannot legally provide them to you. The video owner(s) can choose to delete it at anytime, in which case the video will no longer be available in the dataset. Due to this, unfortunately, some videos in the dataset will be lost over time, and we are unable to help with this issue.
###

**Q2**: Is it normal that a subset of videos cannot be retrieved from the provided URLs?

**A2**: Yes. See Q1.

###

**Q3**: Can you provide download scripts?

**A2**: No, contact me privately if you need help.
